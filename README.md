# Image-Captioning
This project focuses on image captioning by integrating deep learning and NLP. Using the Flickr8k dataset, we apply SVD and Laplace filters for preprocessing, DenseNet201 for feature extraction, and LSTM for caption generation. The model achieves efficient, accurate results with reduced computational complexity.
